# set data type
# unordered collection of unique items
# i a set data type you can't store one data in multipying times it should be use in onetime

# set removes which data are in mulple times

# the main use of set is to make a unique collection of data it means every data should be onetimes in a set


# s = {1,2,3,42,42,22,23,2,3}

# print(s)



# s2 = [1,2,3,5,4,65,4,2,3,8,9,10,21,20,10,1,3,8,9]
# s2 = set(s2)
# print(s2)

# you can change a list by using set and change a set to list by using list method

# set_list = list(set(s2))

# print(set_list)




# set methods

s = {1,2,3,4,5}

# s.add(4)

# s.remove(6)

# s.discard(3)

# s2 = s.copy()

# s.clear()



# print(s)
# print(s2)



# in a set you can'nt store list, tuple and dictionary
# you only store number like integer,floating number and also you store string


s = {1,2.2,1.1,'string','hello'}

# there is no matter which is printing before and after because set is a unordered collection of data

print(s)
