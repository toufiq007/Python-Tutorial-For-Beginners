# how to generate nested list by using list comprehension
# this is called nested list

number = [[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]
# print(number)



# make a nested list by using the list comprehension

# new_list = [[i for i in range(1,4)] for i in range(2)]
# print(new_list)



new_number = [[i for i in range(1,4)] for j in range(1,3)]
print(new_number)









# new_list = []

# for i in range(1,4):
#     new_list.append([1,2,3])

# print(new_list)
