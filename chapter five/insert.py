# you can insert any data in the list by using insert method
# in insert method first you should declare the position and then what should you insert in the list
# and when you want to concatenate two list then you must use + plus operator and only list with list can be added



# popular add method for list in python
# insert()  ==> it is usable to insert data in the list
# append()  ==> when you use append it take the raw list to add another list
# extend()  ==> when you use extent to add a list to another list it works well


fruits = ['apple','mango']
fruits2 = ['orange','banana']

fruits.extend(fruits2)
print(fruits)


fruits.append(fruits2)
print(fruits)
# print(fruits2)
