# STRINGS ARE IMMUATABLE

# when you declare a string then you can't change the value of string ,,you can replace the string by new string but it can't damage your orginal string
# exmple below

name = 'Mostafiz'

# name[0] = 'm'
# print(name[0]);

# new_str = name.replace('z','Z')
# print(new_str)

new_name = name.replace('t','T')
print(new_name)
