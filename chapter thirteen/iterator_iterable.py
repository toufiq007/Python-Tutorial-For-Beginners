# iterator vs iterables


numbers = [1,2,3,4,5] # , tuple and string alls are iterables


# new_number = iter(numbers)

# print(next(new_number))
# print(next(new_number))
# print(next(new_number))
# print(next(new_number))
# print(next(new_number))


square_numbers = map(lambda x:x**2,numbers)

# map , filter this all build functions are iterators


# print(next(square_numbers))
# print(next(square_numbers))
# print(next(square_numbers))
# print(next(square_numbers))
# print(next(square_numbers))
